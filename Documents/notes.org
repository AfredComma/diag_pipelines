** Problems to fix before running
*** Snippy
1. Problem in the bwa header with tabs are not fixed and can occur: fix line 214 of snippy, double escape tabs needed
2. Check which vcftool version is used
3. Otherwise just remove the sanity check from vcftool 
4. Problem in freebayes-parallel. Localize which freebayes-parallel binary is used in the snippy log file, remove the path before vcffirstheader and vcfstreamsort
*** Mykrobe
1. Included --min_variant_conf 100 in the shell command
2. The file mykatlas/typing/typer/presence.py in the conda environment has to be fixed: add on line 160 sequence_coverages=list(sequence_coverages) (see fix https://github.com/Phelimb/atlas/commit/9160ec0a8873494c859775045d1dcf2ada8941e4#diff-997723f7231c49eacf527406b95678d2)
