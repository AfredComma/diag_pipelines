# Those file are specific to each analysis:

# Read naming schemas:
# Read names must end with ".fastq" or ".fastq.gz" or ".fq" or ".fg.gz"
# The following regex must match the naming of your reads : 
# "_(R)?(1|2)(_|.)" for paired reads. Otherwise your sample will be considered as single reads.
# Your sample name will be defined with every character before the regex "_(R)(1|2)", and excluding the patterns "_S[0-9]+_L001"
# If you do not like this sample naming, create a tab seperated file with two columns, the first one with the sample naming previously defined and the second one with your desired names.
# Put this file on the folder where you will run snakemake and the sample_names value below should be the name of this file. 
# If wish to keep the automatic naming, set the value of this variable to empty
